Example usage of AFrame-Quick-UI.  See examples/quick-ui.js for examples of different layouts, etc.  (The same file is present in the AFrame-Quick-UI repo.  For now.)

clone AFrame-Quick-UI as a sibling of this directory (like, "/clones/AFrame-Quick-UI/" and "/clones/AFrame-Quick-UI-Test/") - until I get it published as a proper npm package
npm install
npm start
