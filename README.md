Example usage of AFrameHandMenus (name a WIP).  See examples/hand-menu.js for examples of different layouts, etc.  (The same file is present in the AFrameHandMenusTest repo.  For now.)

clone AFrameHandMenus as a sibling of this directory (like, "~/clones/AFrameHandMenus/" and "~/clones/AFrameHandMenusTest/") - until I get it published as a proper npm package
npm install
npm start
